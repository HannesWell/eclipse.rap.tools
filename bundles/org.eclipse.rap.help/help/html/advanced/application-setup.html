  <h1>Choosing a RAP Application Setup</h1>
  <p>
    There are different application setups to choose from depending on which technologies to 
    use in your application and where to deploy it.
  </p>
  
  <h2>OSGi or stand-alone?</h2>
  <p>
    RAP is designed for modular applications based on OSGi.
    OSGi is a platform that allows you to organize your application in loosely coupled modules, and 
    reuse existing Eclipse plug-ins.
    Besides the reference implementation Equinox, which is used in Eclipse, there exist others 
    like Apache Felix.
    RAP is designed to work with any standard-compliant OSGi implementation.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you do not need or like to use OSGi in your web application, you can still use RWT as a 
    normal Java library. This setup is usually referred to as <q><a href = "rwt-standalone.html">RWT standalone</a></q>.
  </p>
  <h2 id = "compat">JEE or SWT compatibility?</h2>
  <p>
    RWT has are different <a href = "../reference/api/org/eclipse/rwt/application/Application.html#OperationMode">operation modes</a>. 
    The default one is fully compatible with JEE, 
    lightweight, and supports transparent session failover in <a href = "http://wiki.eclipse.org/RAP/RWT_Cluster" >clustering environments</a>. 
    (Clustering currently requires a RWT standalone setup).
    It is the recommended mode in most cases.
  </p>
  <p>
    The alternative is the SWT compatibility mode, which emulates the SWT threading model. 
    To do so, a separate UI Thread has to be started for every new user session.
    Another drawback is that application code does not run in the server's request thread 
    and thus cannot directly access JEE session contexts.
  </p>
  <p>
    SWT compatibility mode is only required for blocking API. In SWT,
    an opend dialog will block code execution until it is closed by the user, and then return 
    a value. In JEE mode the dialog still opens, but code execution will continue, 
    and the return value will be lost. RAP features an <a href = "../reference/api/org/eclipse/rwt/widgets/DialogUtil.html">alternative API</a> that can be used 
    to obtain the value anyway using a callback mechanism. This mechanism does not exist in SWT.
  </p>
  <p>
    The other API that blocks execution are the <code>Browser</code>-widget's execute and evaluate 
    methods. Their return value can also be obtained with <a href = "../reference/api/org/eclipse/rwt/widgets/BrowserUtil.html">callback implementation</a>, but it 
    may be an issue for developing <a href = "../advanced/custom-widget.html#browser">browser-based custom widgets</a>.
  </p>
  
  <h2 id = "workbench">Workbench 3.x</h2>
  <p>
    If you're building an application based on the Eclipse 3.x workbench, you need a platform that
    includes the Equinox OSGi implementation and the extension registry.
    The application and all contributions, such as views or themes, 
    must be <a href = "branding.html">registered as extensions</a>. In this setup, the SWT compatibility mode is enforced.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Deployment</h2>
  <p>
    For OSGi-based applications there are two ways to <a href = "deployment.html">deploy</a> them. 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      They can be deployed directly 
      into an OSGi container together with an OSGi-based servlet engine such as Jetty.
    </li>
    <li>
      Alternatively, the Equinox servlet-bridge allows to embed an OSGi container in a war file.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For RWT-Standalone application the RWT servlet is <a href = "rwt-standalone.html#deploy">configured directly</a> in the servers web.xml file.
  </p>
