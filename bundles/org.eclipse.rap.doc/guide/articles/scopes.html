  <h1>Scopes and Threads in RAP</h1>
  <p>
    While RAP inherits many traits of a desktop application framework from SWT/RCP, it is in fact
    a multi-user, client-server based web framework. This means there are some significant
    architectual differences that need to be considered when building RAP applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a desktop environment, an instance of an application normally serves only a <b>single user</b>,
    runs in its <b>own Java VM</b> instance, and the operating system usually provides a user-specific
    <b>storage on the file system</b>. The <b>UI is rendered on the same machine</b> as
    the application runs on, and when the user exists the <b>application is terminated</b>.
    For RAP applications, these things work differently.
  </p>
  <p>
    A RAP application does not own the VM. It runs on a server and <b>shares the VM</b> with the
    servlet container, other applications, maybe even other RAP applications.
    There are <b>multiple users</b> accessing the application, each one with a <b>separate UI
    connected via HTTP</b>, but all sharing
    the same classes.
    Moreover, a RAP application runs for a very long time.
    When a user logs in, the application is already running, and it may <b>continue to run when
    the user leaves</b>.
  </p><p>
    For these reason, it is necessary to distinguish various scopes and threads in RAP:
  </p>

  <h2>ApplicationContext</h2>
  <p>
    There can be more than one RAP application running at the same time, e.g. on different network
    ports or different contexts paths.
    Every application has its own set of entry points, registered resources and service handler.
    All these things have application scope.
    If you have objects that should be accessible from everywhere in the application, they need to
    have application scope as well. The application scope lives as long as the application runs
    on the server, even if there are currently no clients connected. When the application is
    stopped (i.e. the servlet context is destroyed), all data in this scope is lost.
  </p>
  <p>
    The application scope is represented by an <code>ApplicationContext</code> instance, which can
    be obtained via <code>RWT.getApplicationContext()</code>. It can be used to store any data that is
    shared between all UI sessions of an application, and to acquire application-scoped instances
    of framework services such as the resource manager.
  <p>
   The application context is <em>thread safe</em>, it can be accessed concurrently from different
 threads. Background threads can not access it directly however. (See "UI Thread").
  </p>

  <h2>UISession Context and UI Thread</h2>
  <p>
    The UI session context in RAP spans exactly one execution of an entrypoint.
    It is created when the user connects to the server, and usually ends with a refresh or timeout.
    While UI sessions are built on top of the servlet container's session management,
    they are not identical to the underlying HTTP session.
    For example, when the browser is refreshed (usually by hitting <em>F5</em>) to start over,
    the user still has the same HTTP session, but a fresh UI session.
    Often, what would be a singleton or static field in a desktop application, has to have
    UI Session scope in RAP.
  </p><p>
    A UI session is represented by an <code>UISsession</code> instance, accessible using
    <code>RWT.getUISession()</code>. Similar to <em>application context</em>, it can be used to
    store session-scoped data. It also provides access to the HTTP session and the client object.
  </p>

  <h3>UI Thread</h3>

  <p>
    The UI thread is the thread in which the Display was created.
    Widgets can only be created and accessed in this thread. In addition, anything in RAP
    that requires UI Session context (including <code>SingletonUtil</code> and
    most methods of <code>RWT</code>, like <code>RWT.getUISession()</code> / <code>RWT.getApplicationContext()</code>)
    by default works only within the UI thread.<br/>
    Since all event code is triggered from the UI thread, event listener already have full access
    without any special techniques. However, if an application is forking new threads
    ("non-UI" or "background" threads), this is not the case. See
    <a href="threads.html#access">Session access from a background threads</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Session Timeout</h3>
  <p>

    A UI session ends when the execution of an entrypoint is finished (display is disposed)
    or when the underlying HTTP session times out.
    The timeout interval must be be configured with the servlet container.
    For web applications, this can be done in the web application's deployment descriptor (web.xml):
  </p>
  <pre><code>&lt;session-config&gt;
  &lt;session-timeout&gt;30&lt;/session-timeout&gt;
&lt;/session-config&gt;
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    The timeout value can also be changed programmatically on a per session basis:
  </p>
  <pre><code>RWT.getUISession().getHttpSession().setMaxInactiveInterval(&lt;timeout in Seconds&gt;);
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    Note that when using the RAP launcher, sessions never expire by default.
    To change this, adjust the timeout setting on the <em>Main</em> tab.
  </p>

  <h3>Session Cleanup</h3>
  <p>
    To cleanup session-scoped objects, a <code>UISessionListener</code> can be registered with
    the UI session:
  </p>
   <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><pre><code>RWT.getUISession().addUISessionListener( new UISessionListener() {
  public void beforeDestroy( UISessionEvent event ) {
    // Perform cleanup
  }
} );
   </code></pre></div>
  <!--
  <p>
    There are several ways to do some cleanup before the session is destroyed. The first choice
    in most cases is to attach an <code>SWT.Close</code> listener to the Display or register a
    Runnable with disposeExec():
  </p>

   <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><pre><code>display.addListener( new Listener() {
  public void handleEvent( Event event ) {
    // Perform cleanup
  }
} );
display.disposeExec( new Runnable() {
  public void run() {
    // Perform cleanup
  }
} );
   </code></pre></div>
   -->


  <h2>User Settings</h2>
  <p>
    While there is a new UI Session every time a client connects, a returning user may by identified
    by RAP using a coockie. To associate data with a specific user, the <code>SettingStore</code>
    may be used.
  </p>

  <h2>RAP Client</h2>
  <p>
    Any RAP Client that connects with a RAP server also stores some data, usually for the duration
    of the UI Session. Most noteably, the client has a complete copy of the UI state, which it
    presents to the user to interact with. It can only exchange data during HTTP requests,
    which are triggered by user interacations. That means that if the UI state is changed by a
    background thread, the client would normally not be updated until the next time the user does
    someting with the UI. See <a>Server Push</a> for more.
  </p>

  <h2>HTTP Request</h2>
  <p>
    Some data is also associated with the current HTTP request. However, these are almost
    entirely internals, and should not be of any concern to application developer.
