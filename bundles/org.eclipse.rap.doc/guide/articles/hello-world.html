  <h1>Writing a Hello World with RAP</h1>
  <p>
    This document describes how to quickly create and launch a first user interface with RAP.
    A complete application includes a few more components, depending on your
    <a href = "application-setup.html">application setup</a>.
    If you want to create a Workbench-based application, start with a template instead
    (see <a href = "../examples.html">Examples</a>).
  </p>

  <h2>Preconditions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="setup-ide.html">the RAP Tools are installed</a></li>
    <li><a href="target-install.html">a RAP target platform is installed and active</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Create a new project</h2>
  <p>
    First we need to create a project for your application.
    It is recommended to use a <em>Plug-in Project</em>,
    unless you want to write an <a href = "rwt-standalone">RAP applications
    without OSGi</a>. In the latter case, you can also create a plain <em>Java Project</em> here.
    (If you do so, the project setup will differ slightly from this tutorial. Most notably, you
    will have to add <em>org.eclipse.rap.rwt</em> to the java build path/<em class="UILabel">Required Projects</em>
    in the next step.)
  </p><p>
    From the menu, select <em class="UILabel">File &gt; New &gt; Plug-in Project</em>.
    Let's call the plug-in <code>org.example.rap.helloworld</code>.
    In the <em class="UILabel">Target Platform</em> box, choose
    <em class="UILabel">an OSGi framework</em> and <em class="UILabel">standard</em> to create a
    bundle that is compatible with any OSGi framework.
  </p>
  <img src="../images/hello-world/NewProject-1.png" alt="New Project Wizard"/>
  <p>
    On the second page of the wizard, disable the option
    <em class="UILabel">Generate an activator, …</em>.
    (This option would create a bundle activator, but we don't need that now.)
    Click "Finish".
  </p>
  <img src="../images/hello-world/NewProject-2.png" alt="New Project Wizard"/>

  <h2>Add a dependency to RWT</h2>
  <p>
    To display widgets, we need a dependency to the RAP widget toolkit (RWT), which is RAP's
    implementation of SWT.
    It is contained in the plug-in <em>org.eclipse.rap.rwt</em>.
    To add this dependency, open the bundle manifest file <em>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</em> with
    the <em class="UILabel">Plug-in Manifest Editor</em> (the default for this file type). Go to the
    <em class="UILabel">Dependencies</em> page and add <em>org.eclipse.rap.rwt</em> to the
    list of <em class="UILabel">Required Plug-ins</em> and save.
  </p>

  <h2 id="entrypoint">Create an Entry Point</h2>
  <p>
    Every RAP application needs an entry point class that creates the initial UI of the application.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before we can create the entry point, we need a package.
    A good name for the main package in a bundle is the bundle id,
    so we name the package <em>org.example.rap.helloworld</em>.
    In this package, we create a class named <em>HelloWorldEntryPoint</em> that extends
    <em><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/rap/rwt/application/AbstractEntryPoint.html">AbstractEntryPoint</a></em>.
    In the method <em><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/rap/rwt/application/AbstractEntryPoint.html#createContents(org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Composite)">createContents</a></em>, 
    we add some SWT code. In the example below, we added a Button with the text “Hello world!”:
  </p>
  <pre>
  public class HelloWorldEntryPoint extends AbstractEntryPoint {

    @Override
    protected void createContents( Composite parent ) {
      Button button = new Button( shell, SWT.PUSH );
      button.setText( "Hello world!" );
    }

  }
</pre>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> RAP 1.x also required the SWT <i>main loop</i> here.
    This is no longer needed if <em>AbstractEntryPoint</em> is used.
  </p>

  <h2>Launch the entry point</h2>
  <p>
    Now we can already launch this entry point using the RWT launcher.
    Select <em class="UILabel">Run As &gt; RWT Application</em> from the context menu of the
    entry point class.
    A browser view should open up soon afterwards and show your running application.
    More on launching RAP applications in the chapter
    <a href="./launcher.html">Launching RAP Applications</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Complete the application</h2>
  <p>
    Until now, we only have a project with an entry point.
    To turn this into a complete application, the entry point must be registered so that the
    framework can find it.
    Lightweight OSGi applications register the entry point in their
    <a href="application-configuration.html">application configuration</a>.
    For a workbench application, this would be done <a href="branding.html#entrypoint">using an entry point extension</a>.
