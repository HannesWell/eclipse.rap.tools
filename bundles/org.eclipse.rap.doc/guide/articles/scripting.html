  <h1>Scripting</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    RAP applications are running almost entirely on a Server. All application-relevant events
    that occur on the client have to be forwarded to the Server before being
    processed. Scenarios where minor delays are unacceptable
    (e.g. typing or mouse movements) would therefore be undesirable.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is where RWT Scripting can help. With scripting developers can handle some of
    the events directly on the client, without creating any HTTP-requests. This is ideal to
    customize or enhance the behavior of specific widgets, <em>most notably</em> <code>Text</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The scripts themselves are written in JavaScript on a SWT-like API. This allows application
    developers with SWT-experience to get started right away, and makes porting between SWT and
    RWT Scripting fairly easy. Even without any JavaScript-experience, this document should
    provide you with all the basics you need for RWT Scripting.
  </p>

  <h2 id="api">Java and JavaScript API</h2>
  <p>
    Client event processing works like untyped event handling in SWT, with the main difference that
    the handler itself has to be written in JavaScript. It also does (naturally) not have access
    to all of the resources and functionality that would be available on the server. To attach a
    client side listener to a widget, Instances of this <code>ClientListener</code>
    are used.
  </p>
  <p>
    Example:
  </p>
  <pre class="lang-java">
widget.addListener( SWT.Verify, new ClientListener( scriptCode ) );
  </pre>
  <p>
    The JavaScript source code can define any number of named function, either with
    "<code>var myFunction = function(){};</code>" or "<code>function myFunction(){}</code>".
    The function named "<code>handleEvent</code>" (obligatory) is the one that is called in case an event
    is fired. It takes one argument, which is the <code>event</code> object.
  </p>
  <p>Example:</p>
  <pre>var handleEvent = function( event ){
  event.widget.setText( &quot;Hello World!&quot; );
};</pre>
  <p id="other">Other functions
    can be called from handleEvent to be used as helper. The order in which the functions
    are defined is not relevant.
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/Strict_mode">
    Strict mode</a> is supported and can be activated for the entire script by writing
    <code>&quot;use strict&quot;;</code> in the first line.
  </p>
  <p>
    If your script is longer than a few lines, we recommend to read it from an external file.
    If it is very long and used repeatedly, only one instance of
    <code>ClientListener</code> should be created and shared within the session, for example
    by using the SessionStore or creating a SessionSingleton that extends <code>ClientListener</code>.
  </p>
    <p>
      The Widget object in RWT Scripting is an abstract representation of an SWT widget. It
      has a JavaScript conform of the API of the actual SWT Widget it represents.
      It can be obtained from the
      <a href="../reference/jsdoc/symbols/Event.html#widget"><code>event</code></a>
      object given in <code>handleEvent</code>, or
      from <a href="../reference/jsdoc/symbols/rap.html#.getObject"><code>rap.getObject</code></a>.
      The Scripting API for all widgets that support scripting
      is <a href="../reference/jsdoc/index.html">documented the WebClient API Reference</a>.
      Adding a ClientListener to Widget that does not support Scripting has no effect.
    </p>

        change. The "text" field of the event may be changed to replace the inserted text.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h3 id="data">Transferring Widget Data</h3>

    <p>
      As in SWT the Widget provides
      <a href="../reference/jsdoc/symbols/Control.html#setData"><code>setData</code></a>
      and
      <a href="../reference/jsdoc/symbols/Control.html#getData"><code>getData</code></a>
      methods. These
      allow to attach data to a widget instance without affecting the widget itself.
      Unlike SWT any value can be stored with <code>setData</code>, not just objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data attached to the SWT Widget can be transferred to the scripting widget. To do so,
      the key for that data has to be registered with the
      <code>WidgetUtil.registerDataKeys( String... )</code>, like so:
    </p>
    <pre class="lang-java">
WidgetUtil.registerDataKeys( &quot;foo&quot; );
widget.setData( &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;myData&quot; );
    </pre>
    <p>
      The key has only to be added once per session, but adding it multiple times has no side
      effects. The following types are supported:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>null</li>
      <li>String</li>
      <li>Byte</li>
      <li>Short</li>
      <li>Integer</li>
      <li>Long</li>
      <li>Double</li>
      <li>Float</li>
      <li>Boolean</li>
      <li>int[]</li>
      <li>boolean[]</li>
      <li>String[]</li>
      <li>Object[]</li>
      <li>Map</li>
      <li>JsonValue</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Changing the value on the client does not change it on the server.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widgets can <i>not</i> be transferred, but the id can:
    </p>
    <p>Java:</p>
    <pre class="lang-java">
widget.setData( &quot;otherWidget&quot;, WidgetUtil.getId( otherWidget ) );
    </pre>
    <p>JavaScript:</p>
    <pre class="lang-javascript">
var otherWidget = rap.getObject( widget.getData( &quot;otherWidget&quot; ) );
    </pre>

    <h2 id="limitations">Noteable Limitations and discouraged Usage</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is not (and will not be) possible to prevent <code>Text</code> selection/carret change by
        mouse (using doit flag). Its also not supported to set the Text selection property in a
        MouseDown event. These are also not working (correctly) in SWT. Changing selection on
        Text on a MouseUp works.
      </li>
      <li>Verify event:
        <ul>
          <li>Currently only supported on Text.</li>
          <li>
            Setting the text or selection property <i>of the target</i> within the Verify event is
            not supported, but it doesn't produce useful results in SWT either. The modiy event is
            better suited for this.
          </li>
          <li>
            Changing the events "text" field has no effect if its empty to begin with. (I.e.
            deleting can not be used to insert text).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        In SWT, some key constants can be compared with both the keyCode field and the
        character field (<code>SWT.DEL, SWT.ESC, SWT.BS, SWT.BS, SWT.CR, SWT.TAB</code>). In
        RWT Scripting they can only be compared with the keyCode field. The character field will
        either not be set for these keys, or contain a (JavaScript) string, while these constants
        are numbers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Accessing the window/document Objects is discouraged for cross-browser/cross-client
        compaibility concerns. You can do so at your own risk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Creating global variables from within a ClientListener is also heavily discouraged
        and can easily happen by accident if a
        variable is created without the "var" keyword. Use <a href="#other">strict mode</a>
        and <a href="http://github.eclipsesource.com/jshint-eclipse/">jshint</a>
        to
        prevent this.
      </li>
      <li>
        For <b>security</b> reasons you should be aware that, unlike RAP source code written in
        Java, all RWT Scripting functions (JavaScript source code) are currently transferred to
        the client completely unaltered, <i>including comments</i>,
        and can be read by any user with enough technical expertice.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h2 id="jshints">JavaScript Hints for Java Developer</h2>
    <p>
      Developers experienced with Java programming and less familiar with (or completely new to)
      JavaScript might find the following hints useful in regard to RWT Scripting:
    </p>

    <h3>Debugging</h3>
    <p>
      Most modern browser have built-in developer tools, including a debugger. However,
      since ClientFunctions are created using "eval", the scripts do not simply appear in
      the "Scripts" or "Resources" tab of the developer tools, so it is not possible
      to set a break point. There are two ways to solve this, though browser support may vary:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. To make the Script appear in the developer tools, add the line
      &quot;<code>//@ sourceURL=NameOfYourScript.js</code>&quot; to your script. An newer syntax is
      also &quot;<code>//# sourceURL=NameOfYourScript.js</code>&quot;.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. To set a break point programmatically, write <code>debugger;</code> in your script
      where you wish to start debugging.
    </p>

    <h3>Noteable differences between Java and JavaScript</h3>
    <ul><li><b>JavaScript variables are dynamically typed and have function scope</b></li></ul>
    <p>
      All local variables in JavaScript are delcared with "var" and can contain any type (undefined,
      null, number, boolean, string, object). It is not relevant at all where in the function it is
      declared, its scope is always the entire function.
    </p>
    <ul><li><b>Strings are not objects</b></li></ul>
    <p>
      Strings are primitives in JavaScript, and are compared with "<code>==</code>" (or
      "<code>===</code>"), not "<code>.equals</code>". However, string primitives can be coerced
      into a string object, on which several useful methods are
      <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp">available</a>.
    </p>
    <ul><li><b>A number is not always a number</b></li></ul>
    <p>
      When calculating a numeric value in JavaScript, the result might not always be a number, even
      if it is of the <i>type</i> number. The two cases are <code>infinity</code> (e.g. "<code>10/0
      == infinity</code>") and <code>NaN</code> (not a number, e.g. "<code>Math.sqrt( -1 )</code>").
      <code>NaN</code> can be detected only by using <code>isNaN</code> (e.g. "
      <code>isNaN( Math.sqrt( -1 ) ) == true</code>"). If a number is neither <code>NaN</code> nor
      <code>infinity</code>, it can do most things Javas <code>int</code> or <code>double</code>
      can, including bitwise operations.
    </p>
    <ul><li><b>Arrays have dynamic length</b></li></ul>
    <p>
      Even though their syntax is very similar, JavaScript Arrays behave more like Java Lists than
      Java Arrays. They can store different types in different slots, and can change their length as
      needed. They also have differently named, but similarly working
      <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_array.asp">methods</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Noteable similarities between Java and JavaScript</h3>
    <ul><li><b>Objects and Maps</b></li></ul>
    <p>
      JavaScript Objects (created with a literal "<code>{}</code>") can be used like Java Maps. A
      "<code>map.put( "key", value )</code>" would be "<code>map[ key ] = value</code>", and a
      "<code> map.get( "key" )</code>" would be "<code>map[ "key" ] </code>". In JavaScript,
      <code>value</code> could be of any type.
    </p>
    <ul><li><b>System.out.println and console.log</b></li></ul>
    <p>
      Most browser (but not all!) have some form of javascript console. They all have at least one
      function in common that can be used like <code>System.out.println</code>, which is
      <code>console.log</code>. Some browser also have <code>console.trace</code>. Browser not
      supporting <code>console.log</code> (or in case of InternetExplorer, not having it activated),
      will crash when calling that method, so remember removing all occurrences of console from your
      JavaScript code after debugging.
    </p>
    <ul><li><b>Math and Math</b></li></ul>
    <p>
      The Java <code>Math</code> class and the JavaScript <code>Math</code> object have almost
      identical <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_math.asp">API</a>.
    </p>
    <ul><li><b>Date and Date</b></li></ul>
    <p>
      The JavaScript constructor
      <code><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp">Date</a></code>
      creates objects almost identical in API to instances of Javas <code>Date</code> class.
    </p>
    <ul><li><b>Regular Expressions and RegExp</b></li></ul>
    <p>
      JavaScript also supports
      <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp">regular expressions</a>.
    </p>
    <ul><li><b>char and string</b></li></ul>
    <p>
      JavaScript has no <code>char</code> type. For RWT Scripting, a string with a length of one
      character is used instead. This allows for comparison like
      "<code>event.character == "A"</code>", but not "<code>event.character &gt;= 65</code>".
      To do that use <code>charCodeAt</code>.
      Example: "<code>event.character.charCodeAt( 0 ) &gt;= 65</code>".
