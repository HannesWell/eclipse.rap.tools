  <h1>Browser Navigation &amp; History</h1>
    <p>
      As a RAP application usually runs in a browser, the user will expect that it behaves and
      navigates like a traditional website to a certain degree. It is easy to implement the layout
      of typical websites and web applications using RAP widgets (like TabFolder, Menu, List, etc.).
      However, some concepts, like history support, require special API.
    </p>
    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>There are two kind of links supported in RAP.</p>
    <p>
      First, there is the <code>Link</code> widget as implemented by SWT. This widget
      can display texts that looks like a link, but actually behave like a push button.
      It's convinient to use this Widget to link between different places within your application.
      Combined with the URL-Launcher (see below), it can also be used like an actual link
      to open new websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, it is possible to integrate "real" links in the application using the markup feature.
      Clicking such a link will <em>not</em> trigger any events, but open the given URL (in the
      same window, if there is no target attribute set).
    </p>
    <h2>Open URLs in an external browser/application</h2>
    <p>
      It is possible in RAP to programmatically open any URL without leaving the current
      page/session. This is done using the URL-Launcher client service. Any
      URL starting with "http" (or "https") will open in a new browser tab, window, or pop-up,
      unless it is blocked by a pop-up blocker. (The browser will usually ask the user if he
      wants to allow the site to open new windows in general, just in this case, or never.)
      Other protocols like "mailto" or "tel" will not create a browser window, but might trigger
      another application to open, if one is installed. Examples:
    </p>
<pre><code>UrlLauncher launcher = RWT.getClient().getService( UrlLauncher.class );
launcher.openURL( "http://www.eclipse.org/" );
launcher.openURL( RWT.getResourceManager().getLocation( "my-doc.pdf" ) );
launcher.openURL(   "mailto:someone@nowhere.org?cc=other@nowhere.org"
                  + "&amp;subject=Hello%3F&amp;body=RAP%20is%20awesome!" );
launcher.openURL( "tel:555-123456" );</code></pre>

    <h2>Exit Confirmation</h2>
    <p>
      The <code>ExitConfirmation</code> service can configre a message that can be shown whenever
      the user tries to close the browser window/tab, or navigates to another URL. Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code>ExitConfirmation service
  = RWT.getClient().getService( ExitConfirmation.class );
service.setMessage( "Do you really wanna leave the party?" );</code></pre>
    <p><b>Result:</b></p>
    <p><img style="padding-top:5px" src="../images/exitConfirmation.png" alt="Exit confirmation dialog"/></p>
    <p>
      <strong>NOTE:</strong>
      Some browser may show additional text in the confirmation dialog, or replace
      the text completely for security reasons.
    </p>

    <h2>Deep Links</h2>
    <p>
     Deep links in traditional website are links that point not just to a document,
      but to a specific positon within the document. This is done by adding a <em>fragment id</em>
      to the URL, separated from the path by a "#". For example "<code>http://eclipse.org/#midcolumn</code>".
    </p>
    <p>
      RAP provides the <code>BrowserNavigation</code> service, which allows the application to
      access this fragment.
      After the URL has been entered (or changed - see history support),
      a <code>BrowserNavigationListener</code> is called, and the fragment is available on the
      event object via the <code>getState()</code> method.
      The string can then be used to decide where to navigate in your application.
      If, for example, you are using a TabFolder as your main navigation element,
      a complete implementation could look like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code>final Map&lt;String, TabItem&gt; navigation
  = new HashMap&lt;String, TabItem&gt;();
navigation.put( "employees", employeeTab );
navigation.put( "companies", companiesTab ); // etc...
BrowserNavigation service
  = RWT.getClient().getService( BrowserNavigation.class );
service.addBrowserNavigationListener( new BrowserNavigationListener() {
  @Override
  public void navigated( BrowserNavigationEvent event ) {
    TabItem item = navigation.get( event.getState() );
    if( item != null ) {
      item.getParent().setSelection( item );
    }
  }
} );</code></pre>
  <p>
   The application could then be opend directly at a specific tab using the URL
   "<code>http://myRapApp/#companies</code>".<br/>
   It it is also possible to specifiy a path within the fragment, pointing to a specific
   unit of data:
  </p>
  <pre><code>  public void navigated( BrowserNavigationEvent event ) {
    String state = event.getState();
    if( state.startsWith( "employees/" ) ) {
      showEmpoyee( state.substring( 10 ) );
    } </code></pre>
  <p>
    Opening "<code>http://myRapApp/#employees/john.doe</code>" could then open the application
    already displaying the entry for John Doe.
  </p>
  <h2>Browser History</h2>
  <p>
    Support for browser history means that the user is able to go back to a previous state of the
    application using the browsers "back" button, without ever leaving the page. He can also
    use the browsers history dialog to jump multiple entries back or forwards.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a <code>BrowserNavigationListener</code> is already implemented (see above), all that's left to
    do is to add new entries to the history. To do so, simply call
    <code>BrowserNavigation#pushState( String state, String title )</code>
    whenever your application enters a new state that
    should appear in the history. The state string is the same that will be given in the
    <code>BrowserNavigationEvent</code> when the user presses "back". The title string
    is used for the title of the document and will appear in the browsers history tab/dialog.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>NOTE:</strong> Some browser have issues supporting history and the
    <code>Browser</code> widget in the same application. The back button may sometimes go back in
    the history of the browser widget and in the history of the RAP application simultaneously, or
    not at all.
