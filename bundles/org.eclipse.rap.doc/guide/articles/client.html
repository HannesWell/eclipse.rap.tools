  <h1>The RAP Client</h1>
  <!-- TODO : add links to API reference -->
  <p>
    The term "RAP client" is used to identify the software that displays the actual UI of a
    RAP application, and communicates with the RAP server using the
    <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/RAP/Protocol">RAP Protocol</a>.
    The term does not include the enviroment an instance of
    the client runs in (browser and/or OS), or the hardware ("device") itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    The RAP project includes the default RAP client, written in JavaScript. It it will be referred
    to simply as the "web client" from here on. The web client is downloaded and started
    automatically when the URL of a RAP application is entered into a browser. In-depth
    technical information about this client can be found in the
    <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/RAP/WebClient">RAP Wiki</a>.
    Other client
    implementations than the web client are currently not part of the RAP project.
  </p>
  <h2>The Client Interface</h2>
  <p>
    Every client implementation is represented by a class implementing the <code>Client</code>
    interface, e.g. <code>WebClient</code>. An instance of such a class can be obtained
    from <code>RWT.getClient()</code>. It represents the client instance connected to the current
    RAP session. By using the <code>instanceof</code> operator, the instance can be used to
    identify the client.
  </p>
<pre><code>  if( RWT.getClient() instanceof WebClient ) {
  ...
  }</code></pre>
  <p>
  The client <i>interface</i> mainly specifies the <code>getService()</code> method (described below),
  while the client <i>class</i> (e.g. <code>WebClient</code>) adds the constants to be used in the
  <a href = "application-configuration.html">application configuration</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>Client Services</h2>
  <p>
    Client services are interfaces that can provide client-specific features.
    The <code>getService</code> method of the client object can be used to obtain an implementation
    of a given service, provided it is supported by the connected client. Wether or not
    a service is supported depends on the RAP client implementation, but may also change
    depending on the clients runtime enviroment (browser) and configuration.
  </p>
  <p>If a service is not supported, the method returns null. If this is a possibility given the
    used service and targeted RAP client, a null check should be performed before using the service.
    Currently, all services
    of the <code>WebClient</code> are supported at all times (i.e. on all browser).
  </p><p>
  Example usage of a service:
  </p>
<pre><code>  BrowserNavigation navigation = RWT.getClient().getService( BrowserNavigation.class );
  if( navigation != null ) {
    ...
  }
</code></pre>
  <h3>
    Services of the web client
  </h3>
  <p>These services are all supported by the web client and can be found in the package
  <code>org.eclipse.rap.rwt.client.service</code>.</p>
  <ul>

    <li style="margin-bottom:10px">
      <b>ClientInfo</b>
      <br/>
      Provides the clients locale and timezone offset (in minutes). The locale may
      be null if the client does not specify a locale. In contrast, <code>RWT.getLocale()</code>
      will return the sessions locale which can also be changed programmatically and will never
      be null.
    </li>

    <li style="margin-bottom:10px">
      <b>BrowserNavigation</b>: See <a href="navigation.html#deeplinks">"Deep Links"</a>
      and <a href="navigation.html#history">"Browser History"</a>
    </li>

    <li style="margin-bottom:10px">
      <b>ExitConfirmation</b>: See <a href="navigation.html#exitconfirmation">"Exit Confirmation"</a>.
    </li>

    <li style="margin-bottom:10px">
      <b>URLLauncher</b>: See <a href="navigation.html#launcher">"Open URLs in an external browser/application"</a>.
    </li>

    <li style="margin-bottom:10px">
      <b>JavaScriptExecuter</b>
      <br/>
      Allows executing arbitrary JavaScript code in the window the RAP client runs in.
      This is usually not necessary, but may be useful to work around minor limitations in RAP or
      implement very simple features.
      <strong>NOTE:</strong>
      This feature allows manipulating to the html DOM or accessing internals of the web client.
      Doing so is <b>not</b> recommended and may have unintended consequences, including
      crashing the client.
    </li>

    <li style="margin-bottom:10px">
      <b>JavaScriptLoader</b>
      <br/>
      Can be used to execute entire javascript files on the client. If a file has been
      executed by the client instance once, it will not be executed again.
      The URL has to be within the same domain as the RAP server.
      The <a href="application-configuration.html">ApplicationConfiguration</a>,
      the org.eclipse.rap.ui.resources extension point (for workbench applications),
      or the <a>ResourceManager</a> can be used to register
      a file that can be loaded by the JavaScriptLoader. Especially useful for
      <a href="custom-widget.html">custom widget</a> / custom component development.
      <strong>NOTE:</strong>
      The warnings from <em>JavaScriptExecuter</em> also apply for <em>JavaScriptLoader</em>.
