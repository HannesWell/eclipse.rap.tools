  <h1>Embedding Web-Components</h1>

  <p>
    Using the SWT/RWT Browser Widget, it is possible to embed HTML pages, simple JavaScript
    Applications, Flash-Objects, Java-Applets or any other web component seamlessly in your
    RAP (or SWT) application.
  </p>

  <p>
    In RAP, any HTML document (including JavaScript) placed in a Browser widget
    will end up in an IFrame element. You can call JavaScript from Java by using
    <code>evaluate</code>, and vice versa with the <code>BrowserFunction</code> class.
    It's recommended
    to always use <code>evaluate</code> instead of <code>executeScript</code>, since it throws
    exceptions if the JavaScript execution fails.
    Before you can use <code>evaluate</code>, you must wait until the document is fully loaded,
    using either a <code>ProgressListener</code> or a <code>BrowserFunction</code>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="notes" >RAP-specific notes</h2>
  <h3>Alternatives</h3>
  <p>
    The Browser-Widget is suitable for embedding complete HTML documents and very simple web apps.
    When you only want to display a few lines of rich/formatted text, use the more lightweight
    <a>markup</a> feature instead. Also, keep in mind that each call
    to a <code>BrowserFunction</code> or to <code>evaluate</code> creates an HTTP request.
    To reduce the resulting traffic you can try combining subsequent call, but if you want to embed
    a web app/object that requires a lot of client-server communication, consider using
    the more efficient RAP Remote API.
    <b>Note</b>, however, that
    both, markup and the JavaScript Remote API, are features of the RAP WebClient, and are not
    available in SWT. If SWT-Support is a requirement, use the Brower-Widget in any case.

  <h3>Browser security restrictions</h3>
  <p>
    Since the <code>Browser</code> widget is based on the HTML <em>iframe</em> element,
    all security restrictions regarding cross-frame-scripting apply. This means for
    <code>execute()</code>, <code>evaluate()</code> and <code>BrowserFunction</code> to work,
    the document loaded in the <code>Browser</code> widget has to come from the
    same domain and port that the RAP application is loaded from. This is automatically given
    if the <code>setText</code> method is used, or the file is registered as a static resource.
    <br/>
  </p>

  <h3>Resources</h3>
  <p>
    It's important to decide how your resources (HTML, JavaScript, CSS and image files) are
    provided to the browser widget. If you use only a moderate amount of HTML with inlined
    JavaScript and/or CSS (and <em>no images</em>), or your non-HTML resources can be loaded from
    a different HTTP-server, it will suffice to use the <code>setText</code> method of the browser
    widget. This code would then also run in an SWT application. However, when using
    <code>setText</code>, the Browser can not cache the loaded document, so each new instance has
    to load and parse it again.
    A good example of a custom widget using this strategy is the
    <code>Browser</code>-based <a href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/rap/incubator/org.eclipse.rap.incubator.google-maps.git/">
    Google Maps widget</a>.
    When a not all resources can be inlined in the HTML file (like images), and they are to be
    provided by the RAP application itself, it is necessary to register them as static resources.
  </p>

  <h3>Limitations in JEE Mode</h3>
  <p>
      When using the
      <a href="application-setup.html#compat">JEE compatibility</a>
      <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/rap/rwt/application/Application.html#OperationMode">OperationMode</a>
      (the default for non-workbench based applications), then
      the <code>executeScript</code> and <code>evaluate</code> methods will not block program
      execution.
      Like with dialogs, a workaround is possible using the class
      <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/rwt/widgets/BrowserUtil.html"><code>BrowserUtil</code></a>,
      which lets you register a callback to recieve the results of the <code>evaluate</code>
      call. However, this pattern makes implementing a traditional "getter" impossible.
      In <a href="application-setup.html#compat">SWT compatibility</a> mode you can write:
    </p>
    <pre>
  public String getText() {
    // assuming the web app is already fully loaded and initialized:
    return ( String )browser.evaluate( "return myWidget.getData();" );
  }
  </pre>
  <p>
    In <a href="application-setup.html#compat">JEE compatibility</a> mode you have to write:
  </p>
   <pre>
  public void getText( final MyCallback callback ) {
    BrowserUtil.evaluate( browser, "return myWidget.getData();" new BrowserCallback() {
      public void evaluationSucceeded( Object result ) {
        callback.handleGetText( ( String )result );
      }
      public void evaluationFailed( Exception exception ) {
        throw new RuntimeException( exception );
      }
    } );
  }
  </pre>
  <p>
    If you are writing a custom widget that is supposed to feature getter that need to obtain their
    value using <code>evaluate</code>, either use the SWT compatibility mode, or consider
    another type of custom widget.
