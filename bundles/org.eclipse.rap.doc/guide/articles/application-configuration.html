  <h1>Application Configuration</h1>
  <p>
    This article explains how to configure a RAP application in an <em>OSGi</em> or in an
    <em>RWT Standalone</em> <a href="application-setup.html#summary">setup</a> without the
    extension registry.
    This approach does not apply for workbench-based applications, which are configured using
    extensions (see <a href="branding.html">Branding</a>).
  </p>

  <h2>
    Implementing an ApplicationConfiguration
  </h2>
  <p>
    A RAP application consists of various parts, such as entrypoints, URL mappings, themes,
    service handlers, etc.
    All these parts constitute an <em>ApplicationConfiguration</em>,
    which the framework can use to create and start an application instance.
    There can be more than one application instance at runtime, e.g. running on different network
    ports or different servlet contexts.
  </p>
  <p>
    RAP uses a callback approach to configure applications before they are started.
    For that, an implementation of the interface
    <code><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/rap/rwt/application/ApplicationConfiguration.html">ApplicationConfiguration</a></code>
    is required. Here, the method <code>configure( Application )</code> is invoked with
    a reference to the created <code>Application</code>
    as the sole argument. A minimal implementation registers at least one entry point for
    the application:
  </p>
  <pre><code>public class SimpleConfiguration implements ApplicationConfiguration {

  public void configure( Application application ) {
    application.addEntryPoint( "/simple", SimpleEntryPoint.class, null );
  }

}
</code></pre>
  <p>
    An any application may have any number of entry points, as long as they are mapped
    to different paths. In this case the entry point would be executed when the URL
    <code>http://&lt;rapserver&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/simple</code> is typed into the browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    The third argument can be a map that configures visual aspects of the entry point.
    These may be client-specific, and therefore the client class (i.e. <em>WebClient</em>)
    provides constats to be used with the map. It's possible to specify which theme to use,
    and which icon and name should be displayed in the browser title bar. It's also possible
    to add static HTML to the client documents <em>head</em> or <em>body</em>. That way a simple
    splash screen can be implemented.
  </p>
  <pre>
Map&lt;String, String&gt; properties = new HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;();
properties.put( WebClient.PAGE_TITLE, "RAP Example" );
properties.put( WebClient.BODY_HTML, "&lt;big&gt;Loading Application&lt;big&gt;" );
properties.put( WebClient.FAVICON, "icons/favicon.png" );
properties.put( WebClient.THEME_ID, "MyCustomTheme" );
application.addEntryPoint( "/example", Example.class, properties );
  </pre>
  <p>
    Note that the favicon and any images you might use in the additonal HTML must be registered
    as a static resource. This can also be done in the application configuration with the
    method <em>Application#addResource</em>. Learn more about static resources
    <a href="resources.html">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The theme-id (<em>WebClient.THEME_ID</em>) is the same that is used in the method
    <em>Application#addStyleSheet</em>. Learn more about custom themes and theme contributions
    <a href="theming.html">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The application instance also has methods to
    <a href="application-setup.html">set the operation mode</a> and
    register service handler.
  </p>

  <h2>Registering the ApplicationConfiguration</h2>
  <p>
    When using OSGi, the ApplicationConfiguration can be registered as a service.
    We recommend using OSGi declarative services (DS).
    You can create a service component definition with Eclipse
    (<em class="UILabel">New &gt; Plug-in Development &gt; Component Definition</em>).
    The service component definition is an XML file, usually contained in a directory
    named <code>OSGI-INF</code>. Edit it to point to your configuration implementation as shown below:
  </p>
  <pre><code>&lt;scr:component xmlns:scr="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/scr/v1.1.0"&gt;
  &lt;implementation class="com.example.SimpleConfiguration"/&gt;
  &lt;service&gt;
     &lt;provide interface="org.eclipse.rap.rwt.application.ApplicationConfiguration"/&gt;
  &lt;/service&gt;
&lt;/scr:component&gt;
</code></pre>
  <p>
    When manually creating this file, it also has to be registered in the bundle manifest.
    Add a line like the following to the MANIFEST.MF:
  </p>
  <pre><code>Service-Component: OSGI-INF/configuration.xml
</code></pre>

  <h3>Custom context path</h3>
  <p>
    Applications configurations can be registered for a custom context path by adding the service
    parameter <em>contextName</em> to the service registration. When using declarative services, a
    line like the following can be added to the component definition:
  </p>
  <pre><code>  &lt;property name=&quot;contextName&quot; type=&quot;String&quot; value=&quot;example&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre>
  <p>
    With this configuration, the entrypoint <em>simple</em> defined above will be available at
    <code>http://host:port/example/simple</code>.
  </p>

  <h3>RWT stand-alone</h3>
  <p>
    When using <a href="rwt-standalone.html">RWT as a library</a> in a traditional web application,
    i.e. without OSGi, the ApplicationConfiguration can be registered in the deployment descriptor
    (web.xml) by adding a
    <code>context-param</code> with the fully qualified class name of the implementation:
  </p>
  <pre>
  &lt;context-param&gt;
  &lt;param-name&gt;org.eclipse.rap.applicationConfiguration&lt;/param-name&gt;
  &lt;param-value&gt;com.example.ExampleConfiguration&lt;/param-value&gt;
&lt;/context-param&gt;
</pre>
  <p>
    You can always look up the param-name in the constant
    <code>ApplicationConfiguration#CONFIGURATION_PARAM</code>.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Starting an Application
  </h2>
  <p>
    When an ApplicationConfiguration has been registered as described above, the bundle
    <code>org.eclipse.rap.rwt.osgi</code> will automatically start this application on
    every available HttpService.
    When using Equinox, donâ€™t forget to also include the <code>org.eclipse.equinox.ds</code> bundle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please also ensure that the bundle <code>org.eclipse.rap.ui.workbench</code> is
    <strong>not</strong> included in your configuration. The workbench bundle automatically starts
    an application in the default context that clashes with the registered application unless the
    application is registered with a custom context.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an alternative to letting the framework start the application automatically, applications
    can also be started explicitly using an <code>ApplicationRunner</code>:
  </p>
  <pre>
ApplicationConfiguration configuration = new SimpleConfiguration();
ApplicationRunner runner = new ApplicationRunner( configuration, servletContext );
runner.start();
</pre>

</body>
</html>
